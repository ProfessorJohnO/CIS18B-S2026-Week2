# Advanced Java Course Week 2: Refresher

## Lesson Overview

### Description
In this lesson, you'll refresh your memory about the basics of the Java programming langauge.

### Pre-Requisites

Before starting this lesson, you should have completed the lesson on git and github in from Week 1.  This lesson will assume you have that foundation already.

## Structure:

This lesson is split into 3 Parts:
* Reviewing the Java Development Tools
* Reading the Getting Started Guide
* Completing the Assignments in the **Assignments** folder of this repository.

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before diving into Java fundamentals, ensure you have the correct tools installed and configured.

### Use Github Codespaces

In this course, we will be using Github Codespaces, a free service provided by github that allows you to run a full-featured VS code development environment in your browser.  You may also use VS Code locally if you'd like a more advanced setup, but I won't be able to provide technical support if you decide to use your local environment.

See this video: xxxx to demonstrate how to use a github codespace.

### (Optional) Download Java 17 or Later locally

This course requires Java 17 or newer. If you would like to run the code you develop on your computer, you can do so by downloading the latest version from [dev.java/download](https://dev.java/download/).

To verify your installation, run:
```bash
java -version
```

Note that I will not be able to provide support for any local installations.

### Complete Getting Started Tutorial

Work through the [Getting Started](https://dev.java/learn/getting-started/) section of the dev.java tutorial to familiarize yourself with basic Java concepts and tools.  You can use the terminal in codespaces to follow along with the tutorials.

## Part 2: Java Language Basics

Review the [Java Language Basics](https://dev.java/learn/language-basics/) section of the dev.java tutorial.

**Note:** If you learned Java 8 previously, you'll encounter new concepts here. For example, the `var` keyword for local variable type inference was introduced in Java 10 and is now standard practice.
